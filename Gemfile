#gem "rspec" was changed to this...
group :test do
  gem "rspec"
end
gem "hashie" #hashie gem without specifying a version
gem "sinatra", "1.4.4" #sinatra gem with the specific version 1.4.4 and one only needed
gem "octokit", "~> 2.0" #specifying version 2.0 with a twiddle-wakka
gem "awesome_print", git: "git@github.com:awesome-print/awesome_print.git"
#this is how to get github links for gem

#group :development do
#  gem "pry"
#end
#becomes this...

gem "pry", :group => "development"

#Erika helped with the code along
#twiddle-wakka flocka flame on fleek
